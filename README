= Dirty Associations

Simple plugin to track changes in associations. Fully working, with proper specs to prove it, tested under Rails 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3

== Example

class MommyChicken < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :little_chickens
  dirty_associations :little_chickens
end
class LittleChicken < ActiveRecord::Base
end

and then you can do:

@mommy = MommyChicken.create(:name => "Gertrude")
@mommy.little_chickens.build(:name => "Junior")
@mommy.little_chickens_changed? -> true
@mommy.little_chickens_was -> []

Does now also mixin with ActiveRecord::Dirty to override changed, changed?, changes, and reload_with_dirty

Enjoy!
